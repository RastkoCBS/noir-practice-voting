# Noir Voting System - Practice Project

This repository contains a practice project demonstrating how to implement a simple voting system using the Noir programming language. Noir is a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) focused language that allows developers to create private and verifiable computations. The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on example for learning how to build applications using Noir.

## Project Overview


This project implements a basic voting system where users can vote anonymously, and their votes are validated in zero-knowledge. The project showcases how to create and verify ZK circuits using Noir. Itâ€™s a great starting point for those interested in exploring Noir and understanding how ZKP-based voting mechanisms work.

### Features:

- Anonymous Voting: Voters can submit their votes without revealing their identity.
- Vote Validation: All votes are verified using a ZKP to ensure integrity and correctness.
- Simple Circuit Design: Easy-to-understand Noir circuits to help developers get familiar with the language and ZK concepts.

## Requirements

- Noir installed on your machine.
- Basic understanding of zero-knowledge proofs and Noir syntax.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
``` bash 
git clone https://github.com/RastkoCBS/noir-practice-voting.git
```

2. Install Noir: Follow the installation guide on the [official website](https://noir-lang.org/docs).

3. Navigate to the project directory:
``` bash
cd noir-practice-voting
```
4. Compile the Noir circuits:
``` bash
nargo check
```

### How the Voting System Works
1. A user casts a vote by providing input through a Noir circuit.
2. The system validates the vote without revealing the voter's identity or choice.
3. Zero-knowledge proofs ensure the votes are counted correctly and securely.

### Future Improvements
1. Add more complex vote counting mechanisms.
2. Integrate with a frontend to simulate a real-world voting application.
3. Implement additional privacy features like tallying votes in zero-knowledge.
